# Bookstore In-class Example

## Introduction
During the Tuesday lectures, I do a code demo.  During these demoes, I apply the new concepts that you studied before class.  The intent is to provide an an example that shows how to use new concepts to complete the assignments and the project.

## Using this repository
You can follow along by pulling the latest version of the code before Tuesday's class.  You can setup an Eclipse project based on this repository as well.  

### Setting up Eclipse to use this repository
- Select *File* from the file menu
- Select *import* from the menu that dropped down
- Expand *git* 
- Select *Projects from git (with smart import)
- Select *Clone URI*
- Copy the link for GitHub and setup as usual
- You will need to add JUnit and your JavaFX user library to the build path.

## Updates:
- July 13: Creating Book and BookShelf such that they pass JUnit (or most of them at least).
- July 13: Create a (very simple) text based application that runs in the console and uses Book and Bookstore.
- July 20: Use JavaFX to build a GUI based application using Book and Bookstore.
- July 20: Intro to Object class and toString method.
